Client Server Chat using python

A connection is established between a client and a server to exchange textual changes between the two machine using 
socket() in python provided the programs are running on the two machines.

The port numbers have to be synced before establishing a connection by both the server and the client.
Messages can be sent one at a time i.e. either by the server or the client. 'Quit' or 'Over' keywords must be used to 
transfer the control to the other machine.

Multithreading can be used so that both the machines can send messages at the same time. Implementation multithreading 
will be done soon.
